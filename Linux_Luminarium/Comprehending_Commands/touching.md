## DESCRIPTION

Of course, you can also create files! There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here. You can create a new, blank file by touching it with the touch command:

> hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp
> 
> hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
> 
> hacker@dojo:/tmp$ touch pwnfile
> 
> hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
> 
> pwnfile
> 
> hacker@dojo:/tmp$
> 
It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

## APPROACH
As the instructons said, i moved to tmp directory and created to files called pwn and college and then i typed /challenge/run to get the flag.
