## DESCRIPTION

Every user has a home directory, typically under /home in the filesystem. In the dojo, you are the hacker user, and your home directory is /home/hacker. The home directory is typically where users store most of their personal files. As you make your way through pwn.college, this is where you'll store most of your solutions.
Typically, your shell session will start with your home directory as your current working directory. Consider the initial prompt:
> hacker@dojo:~$
> 
The ~ in this prompt is the current working directory, with ~ being shorthand for /home/hacker. Bash provides and uses this shorthand because, again, most of your time will be spent in your home directory. Thus, whenever bash sees ~ provided as the start of an argument in a way consistent with a path, it will expand it to your home directory. Consider:

> hacker@dojo:~$ echo LOOK: ~
> 
> LOOK: /home/hacker
> 
> hacker@dojo:~$ cd /
> 
> hacker@dojo:/$ cd ~
> 
> hacker@dojo:~$ cd ~/asdf
> 
> hacker@dojo:~/asdf$ cd ~/asdf
> 
> hacker@dojo:~/asdf$ cd ~
> 
> hacker@dojo:~$ cd /home/hacker/asdf
> 
> hacker@dojo:~/asdf$
> 
Note that the expansion of ~ is an absolute path, and only the leading ~ is expanded. This means, for example, that ~/~ will be expanded to /home/hacker/~ rather than /home/hacker/home/hacker.

Fun fact: cd will use your home directory as the default destination:

> hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp
> 
> hacker@dojo:/tmp$ cd
> 
> hacker@dojo:~$
> 
Now it's your turn to play! In this challenge, /challenge/run will write a copy of the flag to any file you specify as an argument on the commandline, with these constraints:

1. Your argument must be an absolute path.
2. The path must be inside your home directory.
3. Before expansion, your argument must be three characters or less.

## APPROACH

This command [/challenge/run] will copy the files present in it to the /f directory
